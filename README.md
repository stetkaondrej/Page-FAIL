- 🚀 **Product Building**: No-code/low-code applications, AI-assisted tools, autonomous agents
- 🎯 **International Business**: Business development, M&A analysis, strategic partnerships

## Philosophy

> Not a user. An architect.

I don't use AI for content creation. I use it as a co-creator for systems, strategies, and products with real impact.
